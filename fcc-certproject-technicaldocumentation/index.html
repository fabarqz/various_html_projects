        <p>
          Yu-Gi-Oh! is a beloved anime and manga franchise created by Kazuki
          Takahashi centered around stories primarily involving characters who
          play a card game called Duel Monsters wherein players acquire cards to
          build a deck of monster,spell, and trap cards in order to battle other
          players to gain victory. It started as a manga in Japan in 1996 and
          has since grown as a globally recognized franchise spawning various
          media such as anime adaptations, a TCG based on Duel monsters, video
          games, toys, and many other products.

        <p>
          The Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG is one part of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game manufactured
          by Konami. It is released globally but is played mostly in North
          America, Latin America, Europe and Australia. It is printed in
          English, French, German, Italian, Portugese, and Spanish. Another
          version of the card game manufactured by Konami is called the Original
          Card Game (OCG). It is mainly played in Japan, South Korea, and other
          parts of Asia including China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia among
          others. It is now exclusively printed Japanese, Korean, and Simplified
          Chinese. Both versions have the same rules and nearly the same roster
          of cards with a few cards that are exclusive to a particularly version
          until it later released to the other version. As a general rule, cards
          printed for the TCG can only be played for TCG tournaments same as
          with OCG cards being legal only in OCG tournaments unless otherwise a
          specific legality is announced for a particular tournament. A game of
          Yu-Gi-Oh! between two players is called a Duel, with players being
          referred to as Duelists.

        <header>Getting Started</header>
        <p>Below are the type of decks needed for a Duel</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Deck">
        <header>Deck</header>
        <p>
          A collection of cards comprised of any of the following: Normal
          Monsters, Effect Monsters, Tuner Monsters, Pendulum Monsters, Ritual
          Monsters, all types of Spell Cards, and all types of Trap Cards. Then
          minimum number of cards allowed is 40 while the upper limit is 60. It
          is generally recommended to have a deck size close if not exact to the
          minimum size of 40 cards to improve consistency of the intended combos
          of the chosen cards.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Extra_Deck">
        <header>Extra Deck</header>
        <p>
          A collection of cards comprised any of the following monster cards:
          Fusion Monsters, Synchro Monsters, XYZ Monsters, Link Monsters. During
          the game, the players can special summon any monster from the extra
          deck provided that their summoning conditions are met or a particular
          effect allows them to summon a monster without strictly adhering to
          the summoning conditions. A player can have no cards in their extra
          deck or have up to a limit of 15 cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Pendulum monsters present on the field are normally sent
          face up on the Extra deck instead of being sent to the graveyard
          unless being sent to the GY as a material cost for an XYZ monster or
          is banished for any reason.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Side_Deck">
        <header>Side Deck</header>
        <p>
          A collection of up to 15 cards that can be put to either main or side
          deck that is not accessible during a match. However after a match,
          players can swap any card from their main and/or extra deck to any
          card from their side deck provided that the number of cards for both
          decks remain the same before and after the swapping of cards. This
          allows the players to customize their deck in preparation for the next
          match by swapping to cards that could help them respond to certain
          mechanics of their opponent's deck deemed troublesome.

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Card_Sleeves">
        <header>Card Sleeves</header>
        <p>
          Plastic Card sleeves can protect the cards from getting bent,
          scratched, and yellowing. When using card sleeves, it should be the
          same for all cards to prevent marking.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Coin">
        <header>Coin</header>

        <header>Counters</header>
        <p>
          Any small objects that could be placed on top of a card to represent
          any counters generated through an effect. Said counters are usually
          used as resource for activation of effects. These can also represent a
          monster's current level/rank that might've changed as a result of an
          effect. Lastly, these can also be used to keep track of the passage of
          turns as required by certain card effects.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Tokens">

          Tokens are used to represent token monsters generated by card effects.
          They can be represented by any materials (usually another card that
          can fit a card zone) that has a distinct way of representing it's
          current position (either attack or defense) as it's also considered a
          monster card.
        </p>
      </section>

          where the all the card fields are printed and organized to facilitate
          for proper placement of cards during a game. Players must place their
          mats such that their halves of the link monster zoners are aligned
          properly. Listed below are the different card zones with a
          corresponding description
        </p>

          face-up Attack Position, face-up Defense Position, and face-down

          face-down. Pendulum Monster Cards can be activated in the leftmost and

        <header>Deck Zone</header>

          Your Deck is placed face-down in this space. You draw cards from here
          to add to your hand. If a card effect requires you to reveal cards
          from your Deck, or look through it, shuffle it and put it back in this
          space afterwards.

          Extra Monster Zone - This is where you put your monsters that are
